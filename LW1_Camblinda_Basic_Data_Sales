Question:
● What happens to other visuals when you click a region?
ANSWER: By default, in most modern business intelligence tools (like Power BI, Tableau, and Looker Studio), clicking a region or data point in one visual cross-filters or cross-highlights other visuals on the same report page. This interaction makes reports dynamic, allowing you to focus on specific data segments. 
● Why is filtering important in BI?
ANSWER: Filtering is a foundational technique in Business Intelligence (BI) and data analysis that narrows down large, complex datasets to display only the most relevant, actionable information. It acts as a "sieve" or "gatekeeper," essential for transforming raw data into meaningful insights, enhancing, and speeding up decision-making. 

Question:
● Does sorting improve readability?
